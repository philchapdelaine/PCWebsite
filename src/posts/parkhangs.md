I just launched a new bootcamp!

![ParkHangs](../images/parkhangs.png)

 An all-in-one platform that allows users interact with all official Vancouver, British Columbia Parks. Users can get detailed information about a specific park, save favourite parks (if they are logged in), create and integrate events to their own calendar application, as well as write comments about parks and events.
