![Website](../images/website.png)

* My first attempt at a personal website, designed using Figma
* Built using Gatsby.JS and CSS, while incorporating Material-UI components 
* Used GraphQL in order to query, sort, and display markdown files representing my work experience and projects
* I built the website by referencing [Andrew Mead's gatsby tutorial](https://mead.io)
