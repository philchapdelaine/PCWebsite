![ParkHangs](../images/parkhangs.png)

 * An all-in-one platform that allows users interact with all official Vancouver, British Columbia Parks.
 * Users can get detailed information about a specific park, save favourite parks (if they are logged in), create and integrate events to their own calendar application, as well as write comments about parks and events.
 * Implemented the front end and all endpoints (fetch, add, and delete) for comments, ratings, and events
 * Worked with the react Google Maps Plugin to display parks in app
